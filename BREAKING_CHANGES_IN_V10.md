# Breaking Changes

* Only supports react@16.3 and above(+ preact)
* functions in interpolations are stringified in css and cx calls(probably won't affect you very much, there's a warning about it in v9)
* `create-emotion-styled` is gone, use the new styled api and a provider
* MORE STUFF THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER RIGHT NOW
